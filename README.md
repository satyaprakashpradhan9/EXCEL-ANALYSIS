# FRESHCO HYPERMARKET CAPSTONE PROJECT REPORT

## Introduction

This report presents a detailed analysis of the Freshco Hypermarket Database, divided into four primary sections: Order-Level Analysis, Completion Rate Analysis, Customer-Level Analysis, and Delivery Analysis. Each section delves into specific aspects of the data to uncover meaningful insights.

## Order-level Analysis

* Conducted an analysis of order distribution across various delivery slots and delivery areas.
* Determined the geographical areas with the most significant increase in monthly orders between January and September.
* Calculated delivery charges and discounts as percentages of product amounts at the slot and month level to assess their impact on order value.
* Determined the percentage discount applied to product amounts for each combination of drop area and delivery slot to assess the impact of discounts on order value.

    **Key Finding:** HSR Layout exhibits the highest number of orders during the afternoon time slot.

## Completion Rate Analysis

* Analyzed completion rates across different delivery slots and days of the week to identify potential patterns and trends, aiding in optimized scheduling and resource allocation.
* Determined completion rates for each drop area to evaluate delivery efficiency in different regions, providing insights for logistics and delivery optimization.
* Analyzed completion rates in relation to the number of products per order to gain insights into customer behaviour and preferences.
* Provided a detailed analysis of patterns observed in the completion rate data to identify opportunities for improving order fulfilment and enhancing customer satisfaction.

    **Key Finding:** Count of 1-5 Products ordered having the highest percentage of Orders Completed.

## Customer-level Analysis

* Identified completion rates based on customer acquisition sources, shedding light on the performance of different acquisition channels. This information is vital for optimizing marketing efforts.
* Calculated the Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) for individual customers, enabling a deeper understanding of long-term customer profitability.
* Aggregated LTV data to assess the overall performance of customer acquisition sources and acquisition months. This analysis helps in resource allocation and marketing strategy refinement.
* Determined the average revenue (product amount after discount) per order at different customer acquisition source and acquisition month levels. This information is essential for pricing and promotional decisions.
* Explored potential patterns in order ratings concerning various factors such as delivery slots, the number of items ordered, delivery charges, and discounts. These insights can inform service improvement initiatives.

    **Key Finding:** Afternoon Time Slot, having the highest number of 5-Star Rating (4073).

## Delivery Analysis

* Calculated the average overall delivery time at the month and delivery area levels. This analysis provides insights into delivery efficiency and customer expectations.
* Analysed delivery times categorized by weekdays and weekends, allowing for a comparison of delivery performance during different times of the week.
* Assessed the average delivery time by delivery slot, which is crucial for optimizing delivery logistics and meeting customer expectations.
* Examined patterns in delivery charges concerning delivery slots and delivery areas. Understanding these patterns can guide pricing strategies.
* Investigated patterns in delivery times concerning specific delivery areas and identified any potential reasons for variations. This analysis helps in optimizing delivery routes and reducing delivery times.

    **Key Finding:** Late Night Time Slot, having the least amount of Delivery time, due to the less amount of traffic and other factors.

## CONCLUSION

The detailed analysis of the Freshco Hypermarket Database has provided valuable insights into various aspects of the business, including order distribution, completion rates, customer behaviour, and delivery efficiency. These insights are instrumental in making data-driven decisions and implementing strategies for improving overall performance. Based on the findings, I recommend implementing targeted strategies to address observed patterns and enhance customer satisfaction, delivery efficiency, and order completion rates. Continuously monitoring and analysing data is essential to adapt to changing market conditions and customer preferences effectively.
